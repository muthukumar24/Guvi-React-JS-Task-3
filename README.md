# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

====================================================

This Repository is created for submitting the allocated task from React JS Day 5 session.

The given task is to develop a Todo Application using React JS.

Work Flow of Todo Application:

- Enter "Todo Name" and "Todo Description" in given input fields.

- You can set the status as "Completed" or "Not Completed" from select option before clicking the Add Todo button. By default the status of the todo will be in "Not Completed".

- After Clicking the "Add Todo" Button You can see your Todo card that contains "Todo Name" and "Todo Description" and current "status" of the todo and "edit", "delete" buttons.

- The "Status Filter" on the right side will help you to filter the todos according to the status. If we want the completed todos we can select "Completed" from status filter. If we want the not completed todos we can select "Not Completed" from status filter. If we want both completed and not completed todos we can select "All" from status filter. By default the status filter will be in "All".

- In todo card, You can select the status from "Not Completed" to "Completed" and from "Completed" to "Not Completed" by using the "Status" option.

- With the Edit button we can update the current todo which is todo name and todo description and by clicking the "update todo" button the updated todo will be added in todo card.

- Delete button will delete the todo from todo list. 

NOTE: I have attached screenshots for your reference.
